~~~~Fetch style guide~~~~

The Python in Fetch should comply with PEP 8, with the following modifications.

- Multiple spaces before/after operators are allowed if it aligns the code "more readable"
    Example:
    coarse_filter_map = {
        "starts":    (starts_filter, FILTER_MODE_TEXT),
        "ends":      (ends_filter, FILTER_MODE_TEXT),
        "contains":  (contains_filter, FILTER_MODE_TEXT),
        "matches":   (matches_filter, FILTER_MODE_TEXT),
        "length":    (length_filter, FILTER_MODE_TEXT),
        "children":  (children_filter, FILTER_MODE_HTML),
        "findall":   (findall_filter, FILTER_MODE_HTML),
    }

- One-word comments may skip the leading space after the '#' characters, if the comment is meant as a "hashtag"
  that can be grepped for later by tools.
    Example:
    def get_output(mode="json"):  #shittycode

- For auto-generated code such as parsetab.py, no rules apply (since it's not really possible to control.

- For PLY method naming, the rules don't apply since having names like def t_NUMBER(t) is the common pattern.

Any code not complying to this style guide should be considered a bug and bug reports will be appreciated.
