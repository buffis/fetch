~~~~Fetch style guide~~~~

The Python in Fetch should comply with PEP 8, with the following modifications.
- Number of newlines between top-level methods/classes can be 0-2 depending on what looks nicer.

These modifications are purely motivated by my own preference.
Any code not complying to this style guide should be considered a bug and bug reports will be appreciated.

NOTE: There's a bunch of violations currently. Cleanup sweep needed!
